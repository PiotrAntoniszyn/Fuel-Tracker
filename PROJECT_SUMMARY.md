# Fuel Tracker MVP - Project Summary

## ✅ Completed Features

### 🏗️ Core Infrastructure
- **Database Schema**: Complete PostgreSQL schema with proper constraints and indexes
- **Authentication**: Supabase-based user authentication with registration/login
- **PWA Configuration**: Manifest, service worker, and mobile optimization
- **Environment Setup**: Proper configuration management with .env files

### 📱 User Interface
- **Quick Add Form**: Fast fuel entry with validations and auto-focus
- **Entries List**: Sortable, filterable table with all calculated metrics
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Three key charts for price, consumption, and accuracy trends
- **Mobile Optimized**: Responsive design with touch-friendly controls

### 🧮 Calculations (Per Specification)
- **Price per Liter**: `amount_pln / liters`
- **Full-to-Full Consumption**: Only calculated between complete fill-ups
- **Cost per 100km**: Total cost divided by distance for full segments
- **Range Accuracy**: Comparison of predicted vs. actual range with percentage accuracy

### 🔧 Additional Features
- **Data Validation**: Comprehensive input validation (odometer increasing, positive values)
- **Filtering**: Full tank only, date range filtering
- **Deployment Ready**: Scripts for easy local running and cloud deployment

## 📊 Technical Implementation

### Database Design
```sql
CREATE TABLE fuel_entry (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    ts TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
    liters NUMERIC(6,2) NOT NULL CHECK (liters > 0),
    amount_pln NUMERIC(8,2) NOT NULL CHECK (amount_pln > 0),
    range_before_km INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (range_before_km >= 0),
    range_after_km INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (range_after_km >= range_before_km),
    odometer_km INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (odometer_km > 0),
    is_full_tank BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE
);
```

### Key Algorithms
1. **Full-to-Full Consumption**: Finds consecutive full tank entries and calculates consumption only for complete segments
2. **Range Accuracy**: Compares predicted range with actual distance to next fill-up
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Works without JavaScript, enhanced with PWA features

- Multi-vehicle support
- Data export functionality

## 💰 Estimated Costs

### Development Time: ~20-25 hours
- Database setup: 2h
- Core application: 12h  
- Authentication: 2h
- Mobile optimization: 3h
- Testing & polish: 3h
- Documentation: 3h

### Operating Costs: €0/month initially
