### Full-to-Full Consumption
- Consumption is only calculated between full tank entries
- This ensures accurate measurements by accounting for tank variations
- Formula: `(fuel_used / distance) Ã— 100`

### Range Accuracy
- Compares your car's predicted range vs. actual distance driven
- Formula: `100% - |predicted - actual| / predicted Ã— 100%`
- Helps you understand how reliable your car's range estimates are

### Cost per 100km
- Total cost divided by distance for full-to-full segments
- Useful for budgeting and comparing efficiency
